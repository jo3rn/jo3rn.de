## Prerequisites

If you do not have Gatsby Cli installed yet, do it first.

```text
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

More information on [GatsbyJS.org](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-one)

## Getting started

Install the starter using Gatsby Cli `gatsby new` command.

```text
gatsby new [NEW_SITE_DIRECTORY_FOR_YOUR_BLOG] https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog.git
```

Go into the newly created directory and run

```text
gatsby develop
```

to hot-serve your website on http://localhost:8000 or

```text
gatsby build
```

to create static site ready to host (/public).

##### External services

The starter uses external services for analytics. To use them you have to secure some access data. All services are free to use or have generous free tiers big enough for a personal blog.

Create an `.env` file like below in the root folder. Change `...` placeholders with real data.
<br />By default, your `.env` file will be ignored by git. Remove `.env` from `.gitignore` in order to be able to push the file to your repository.

```text
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=...
```
